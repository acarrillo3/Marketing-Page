## Marketing-Page & About-Page
During the first month at lambda school, I had the opportunity to work with 5 other web developer in the creation of 30 BEFORE 30 SPA site.

I builted the landing page and matched the UX design, practicing mainly web responsiveness. Such as px, em, rem, % based widths, flex-box, and media quaries.
